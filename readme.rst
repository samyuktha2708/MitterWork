The site uses two API to do the task first is Google API that returns the latitude and longitude of the address, city ,country or zip and based on the latitude and longitude we get the result form another API SEEclickFix. The seeclickfix returns JSON result format from which we parsed it into array and show the result in a bootstrap table. The site uses PHP language framework named codeigniter.
